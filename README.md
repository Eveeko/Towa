## Info
**Tora** is designed to be a **__Start-And-Forget__** replacement for the in-game announcer in League of Legends.
The main features that makes Tora a viable tool to use compared to others:

- Usage of **AnnouncerPacks**
- Baked in tool to help with creating Packs
- **SmartStart** for launching with the client
- Enhanced Events with **ToraVision**
- Tray mode
- Compliant with RiotGames TOS

## Usage
### Windows installation.

1. Go to the release section of this Repo *(right side)* and dowload the latest release .exe file.
> **Currently Tora only supports Windows. Linux and Mac support is planned down the road once Tora approaches full release**.
2. Run the installer and proceed with the installation until you reach the *'Launch Tora'* dialgoue.
3. Make sure the box is checked and then click **__'Finish'__**.
4. After Tora launches, Select an **__AnnouncerPack__** from the *'Change Announcer'* drop-down menu.
5. Click *'Start'*, Tora will now start looking for a active game and events happening.

To stop Tora at anytime, just click *'Stop'* in the main window or *'Disable'* in the Tray Menu. There is also a tray function that allows you to control the core of Tora with your *System Tray*.
Simply Right-Click the *Minion icon* in your *System Tray* to open the menu, then select the appropriate option.
> Left-Clicking the Tray icon will open the main window instead.
